Rubik's Cube Simulator

The Rubik's Cube consists of 6 faces arranged as follows:

.0..
1234
.5..

Each face rotates clockwise with a specific command and counterclockwise with an appended apostrophe (') to the command. The cube's faces are colored White, Orange, Green, Red, Blue, and Yellow, starting in a default position:

.W..
OGRB
.Y..

Each face has a 3x3 tile configuration. The starting position is:

0:WWWWWWWWW,1:OOOOOOOOO,2:GGGGGGGGG,3:RRRRRRRRR,4:BBBBBBBBB,5:YYYYYYYYY

To rotate each face, use the following commands:

Face 0 (White) clockwise: U, counterclockwise: U'
Face 1 (Orange) clockwise: L, counterclockwise: L'
Face 2 (Green) clockwise: F, counterclockwise: F'
Face 3 (Red) clockwise: R, counterclockwise: R'
Face 4 (Blue) clockwise: B, counterclockwise: B'
Face 5 (Yellow) clockwise: D, counterclockwise: D'

Combine rotations by separating them with commas.
