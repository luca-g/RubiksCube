The Rubik's Cube consists of 6 faces arranged as follows:
x0xx
1234
x5xx

Where 0: top, 1: left, 2: front, 3: right, 4: back, 5: bottom.

Each face contains an array indexed like this:
012
345
678

Faces can rotate in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. 
Rotating faces 0 and 5 affects faces 1, 2, 3, and 4 directly. 
For example, rotating face 1 means row 0 values will be replaced by 
the row 0 values of face 2, and so on.

In some cases, indices need to be inverted. For example, to rotate 
face 1 clockwise, you would copy the values from face 4 column 2 
to face 0 column 0, inverting the indices like so:
F[0][0,3,6] = F[4][8,5,2]

To simplify notation and reduce errors, this format represents rotations:
Face [F] (face id) [R/C] (row/column id) [n/i] (normal/inverted)

Counterclockwise rotations are not listed separately, as they can be achieved 
by inverting the operation order.

Rotate face 0 clockwise (key U):
F1R0n=F2R0n
F2R0n=F3R0n
F3R0n=F4R0n
F4R0n=F1R0n

Rotate face 5 clockwise (key D):
F1R2n=F4R2n
F2R2n=F1R2n
F3R2n=F2R2n
F4R2n=F3R2n

Rotate face 1 clockwise (key L):
F0C0n=F4C2i, (F4 has inverted indices, denoted by "i")
F2C0n=F0C0n,
F5C0n=F2C0n,
F4C2i=F5C0n

Rotate face 2 clockwise (key F):
F0R2n=F1C2i
F1C2n=F5R0n
F3C0n=F0R2n
F5R0n=F3C0i

Rotate face 3 clockwise (key R):
F0C2n=F2C2n
F2C2n=F5C2n
F5C2n=F4C0i
F4C0i=F0C2n

Rotate face 4 clockwise (key B):
F0R0n=F3C2n
F1C0i=F0R0n
F3C2n=F5R2i
F5R2n=F1C0n
