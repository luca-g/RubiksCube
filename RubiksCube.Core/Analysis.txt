The Rubiks cube is composed by 6 faces following this structure:
x0xx
1234
x5xx

Where 0:top,2:front,5:bottom,1:left,3:right,4:back

Each face is composed by an array with this index:
012
345
678

Each face can rotate in 2 ways: clockwise and counterclockwise.
Rotating face 0 and 5 is simple because faces 1234 are directly connected to each other.
for example Face 1 Row 0 values will be replaced by Face 2 Row 0 values and so on.

In other cases the indexes needs to be inverted:
To rotate face 1 clockwise Face 0 Column 0 copy values from Face 4 Column 2 inverting the indexes:
F[0][0,3,6]=F[4][8,5,2]





Rotate 0 clockwise (key U):
F1R0n=F2R0n
F2R0n=F3R0n
F3R0n=F4R0n
F4R0n=F1R0n

Rotate 5 clockwise (key D):
F1R2n=F4R2n
F2R2n=F3R2n
F3R2n=F4R2n
F4R2n=F1R2n


Rotate 1 clockwise (key L):
F0C0n=F4C2i => here F4 has inverted indeces, I add an "i" to signal inverted
F2C0n=F0C0n
F5C0n=F2C0n
F4C2i=F5C0n

Rotate 2 clockwise (key F):
F0R2n=F1C2i
F1C2n=F5R0n
F3C0n=F0R3n
F5R0n=F3C0i

Rotate 3 clockwise (key R):
F0C2n=F2C2n
F2C2n=F5C2n
F5C2n=F4C0i
F4C0i=F0C3n

Rotate 4 clockwise (key B):
F0R0n=F3C2n
F1C0i=F0R0n
F3C2n=F5R2i
F5R2n=F1C0n
