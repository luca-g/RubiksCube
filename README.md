# RubiksCube

Welcome to the Rubik's Cube Simulator, a console-based application designed to offer a virtual experience of solving a Rubik's Cube. This simulator replicates the physical actions of rotating the Rubik's Cube faces in a 3D environment.

## Features
Simulate rotations of the Rubik's Cube in all directions.
Apply sequences of moves using simple commands.
Visualize the state of the cube at any point in time.

##How to Build/Run:
To get started with the Rubik's Cube Simulator, follow these simple steps:

Visit the GitHub repository and download the project folder to your local machine. Alternatively, you can use Git to clone the repository directly.

Open Visual Studio and navigate to the 'Open Project/Solution' option. Locate the downloaded folder and select the solution file (RubiksCube.sln) to open the solution in Visual Studio.
Set the Starting Project

In the Solution Explorer within Visual Studio, find the **RubiksCode.Console** project. Right-click on it and select **'Set as StartUp Project'**. This action tells Visual Studio to run this specific project when you start the application.

Press the **'Start'** button in Visual Studio or use the **F5 key** to build and run the application. The console window will open, displaying the Rubik's Cube Simulator's initial state and available commands.

Follow the on-screen instructions to input commands and rotate the cube.

## Analysis

In the RubikCube.Console project, the **Analysis.txt** file details the implementation of the rotation algorithm, offering insight into the solution strategy used.

Happy cubing!
